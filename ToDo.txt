ToDo.txt
========


O   Change this:

    @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITableView *frontTable;
    
    to this:
    
    @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIScrollView *masterScrollView;
    
    So that the user can program their view however they want, then have to remember to assign the masterScrollView to the scrollView they want to use to control the background table.
    

O   Consider making this class possible with categories instead of subclassing.
